<h4 style="font-size:20">Time is my personal favorite type of donation. You can help people so much through donating time and there are so many different places to do so!  I encourage you to donate time because when you do, you make connections with those you help. I have donated at mulitple places, including a humane society and a food bank. Both were very fun experiences and I plan to donate my time there again. Donating at the food bank was a fun experience because everyone that came to get food was excited and always smiling. The humane society was also fun because you could tell that the animals needed attention.  A benefit is that when you help out, it makes you feel good about yourself. I think you would love donating your time if you tried. </h4>
